The main purpose of this software is to help people suffering of a color vision deficiency (sometimes called color blindness),
the reduced ability to see colors causes constant discomfort in daily life, making it necessary to ask other people for support to fulfill their tasks.

There are many similar tools on the web but often each one has some gaps, usually for lack pick up colour from the screen, lack of the hue name, non-updatable colour lists, not open-source, or limited to web use.
Here i have tried to fill these gaps trying to provide a simple interface.

This software is not intended for professional use, the search for colour names is done by calculating the metrics of [colour spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference) (like CIEDE2000),
and is dependent on internal colour lists.

## How works

1) Press the button "Pick from screen" to choose a color from the screen, then move the mouse over the color to be chosen and click it.
2) Will be show the chosen color info

**How the color name is searched**

To find the name of the colour the software performs a search in the internal colour lists to find the best match with the color you have chosen.
For "best match" in most cases means an approximate colour which does not have the same Hex/RGB code but it is very close.

**The details panel**

In this panel you can view the best matches found with the chosen color,
you can compare the color preview of each result by enabling "Compare color preview" from "Preferences" menu.

The "distance value" indicates the distance to the chosen color,
so when the value is smaller it means that the color is more like the chosen color,
if the value is high it means that the colour is more different,
in cases where the value is 0 it means that the color is identical to the chosen color.

**The internal color lists**

The software works off-line so it does not need an internet connection,
therefore color lists from different sources are included which will be used to search for the color name and hue name.

These lists are contained in standard JSON file contained in the "ColorLists" folder and are easily upgradable
with any editor or through easy scripts like Python.

For more info read json_file_info.txt file in the "ColorLists" folder.
